### Describe what the following command does and why it is widely used: a ||= b.

The "a ||= b" command is a programming construct that supports conditional assignment operators.
The reason why this construct is widely used is its simplicity and efficiency in defining default or fallback values for variables.

     Practical examples in Ruby:
     
     Example 1:
         x = nil
         y = 5
         x ||= y
         puts x  # The value of x will be 5, because x has no assigned value yet
 
     Example 2:
         a = 10
         b = 20
         a ||= b
         puts a  # The value of a will be 10, because a is already assigned a value

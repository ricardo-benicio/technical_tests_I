### What is the meaning of self in ruby classes?

     In Ruby, the 'self' keyword plays an important and versatile role within classes. 
     It refers to the current object on which the method is being called. 
     'Self' in Ruby is a dynamic reference to the current object, 
     be it an instance of the class or the class itself in different contexts. 
     Its use is one of the features that make Ruby a very flexible object-oriented language.
